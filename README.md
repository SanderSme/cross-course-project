## Description

Gamehub is a fictional gaming website/store, where you can buy and sell new and used video games. The site is made for my cross-course project, and have been worked on through the whole first year at Noroff. The last update for the site was that instead of hardcoding every game in HTML and CSS, the products are stored at WordPress, and fetched from there through rest API. This site is no longer hosted on WordPress, as I had a new project I needed webhost for, so fetching the products will not work until a new host is provided.
